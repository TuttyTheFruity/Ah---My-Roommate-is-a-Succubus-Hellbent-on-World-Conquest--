"Lucca and I make our way back towards the plaza, since it's actually pretty empty at this time of day."

"As we're walking, I note quietly that there's no sign of the sound equipment that Kamika left behind after yesterday's incident."

"It seems unlikely to me that she returned to the scene to collect it, so it's either in a lost-and-found right now or enterprising students got a bunch of free stuff."

"I don't even realize the memory of yesterday's hijinks has my face twisted all up into a frown until Lucca shoots me a concerned look."

luc "Is... is everything alright?"

voice "c-14ii-2.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah. I'm just frustrated thinking about stuff."

voice "c-14ii-3.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I think I'm just one of those people... When something weird is going on in my life, there's a part of me that really wants to just shut everything else down until it's over with, even though I know I don't really {i}have{/i} to."

voice "c-14ii-4.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "B-but, you... don't?"

voice "c-14ii-5.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "You've always done a really g-good job of staying on task, no matter what happens."

voice "c-14ii-6.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Really? It never actually feels that way..."

voice "c-14ii-7.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I guess it {i}is{/i} true that I've always had to adapt to whatever weird crap my brother was getting up to in the background."

"Though, it always felt like I had to compromise something in the process..."

voice "c-14ii-8.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "That's... that's really impressive, though! Ad-admirable, even!"

voice "c-14ii-9.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I've always wished I c-could have that kind of focus... I, I can never seem to follow through w-with anything I want to do..."

voice "c-14ii-10.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Seriously? That doesn't seem to sound like you."

voice "c-14ii-11.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Huh?"

voice "c-14ii-12.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I mean, what about following through a weird major so that you can go into street art? And you're actually, like, putting yourself out there with your work."

"As soon as I mention her art, it's strange - her eyes seem to cloud over, and for a moment, she seems ten miles away."

voice "c-14ii-13.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Well..."

voice "c-14ii-14.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I {i}do{/i} love graffiti, that's true, but... it's not the first thing I've studied here. What if it's not the l-last?"

voice "c-14ii-15.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah, so what, though? Students change their majors all the time. I mean, heck, one of my professors used to be a med student."

voice "c-14ii-16.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Yes, but..."

voice "c-14ii-17.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I've sort of... been attending this school for twenty-six years..."

voice "c-14ii-18.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "WHAT?!"

##Lucca exasperated, like X-O

voice "c-14ii-19.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I can't help it! Every t-time I get far with s-something, I just panic! Wh-what if it's not good for me? What if I l-lose interest in it?"

voice "c-14ii-20.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Graduating is {i}scary{/i}!"

voice "c-14ii-21.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I... um... wow."

"I guess this would explain how she knew about those abandoned dorms to vandalize them in the first place... She probably lived in them when she first started going here!"

"Still - {i}twenty-six{/i} years?"

"Even acknowledging that there's probably less pressure to grow up when you literally don't age - at least not on any scope perceptible to a human lifespan - that seems absurdly gratuitous."

voice "c-14ii-22.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Are you worried you're just stuck in a loop now? That you'll convince yourself you don't like street art and start from scratch {i}again{/i}?"

voice "c-14ii-23.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I don't know! M-maybe?"

voice "c-14ii-24.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I really love graffiti, but leaving here's j-just such a big change and - {i}I don't know{/i}!"

voice "c-14ii-25.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Mmm... I guess I could understand not wanting to leave. You've been here longer than I've been alive, after all."

voice "c-14ii-26.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "But still, I'm surprised - isn't this exactly the sort of thing you and your sisters would help a mortal with? Pushing people into having that sink-or-swim moment?"

voice "c-14ii-27.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Just seems like it should be a \"physician, heal thyself\" kind of thing."

voice "c-14ii-28.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "No, the others w-wouldn't ever have this kind of problem... But they can also be patient with me... Except Levi, she's starting to get a little f-fed up."

voice "c-14ii-29.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "But I'm just not g-good at going off and doing things on my own! It's why they've always been so important to me! When we're together, it's d-different."

voice "c-14ii-30.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "It sounds like that frustrates you a little, though?"

voice "c-14ii-31.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...Maybe! Kinda! Yes?"

voice "c-14ii-32.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...I only asked one question, but okay."

voice "c-14ii-33.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "B-but, that's not the point!"

voice "c-14ii-34.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "And anyway, that... that's n-not what we're here to talk about!"

voice "c-14ii-35.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Kamika! Do you know what k-Kamika's up to?"

"It's probably the most obvious evasive maneuver I've ever seen, but I guess I'll let it slide for now, because that really {i}is{/i} something we need to discuss."

voice "c-14ii-36.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "In terms of the so-called \"Phase 2\" of her plan? Not so much."

voice "c-14ii-37.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I don't really know that there's a whole lot we can do to anticipate it, really - or what the benefit would be to knowing in advance."

voice "c-14ii-38.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Hmm..."

voice "c-14ii-39.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Maybe you should j-just ask her?"

voice "c-14ii-40.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Hmm."

voice "c-14ii-41.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Loathe as I am to give her the idea that I actually care what she's up to, she might just tell me, if I did that. I mean, it's not like she's planning to set off a bomb."

voice "c-14ii-42.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I guess that'll do."

##Lucca vaguely confident

voice "c-14ii-43.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Yes, great!"


#MEMO: instance of S-Tan, correct later
voice "c-14ii-44.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I'm glad we're taking care of this on our own... It's better, for S-Tan not to get involved..."

voice "c-14ii-45.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait, what do you mean? Weren't you the one who told me I should call in the first place?"

voice "c-14ii-46.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I d-did, but... not for conflict resolution. She's... actually really scary when she gets mad."

##yumi scared :O

voice "c-14ii-47.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...And a billion trees in Siberia get knocked down?"

"She hesitates to answer, and suddenly I wonder if I'm going to live to regret calling her."

"Or, you know. Not live."

## yumi nervous

voice "c-14ii-48.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You know what? While we're waiting on Kamika, I'm just... going to call ahead and let Satan know we're fine..."

voice "c-14ii-49.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Oh, um, sure, if you like..."

voice "c-14ii-50.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Please please please don't tell else anyone this, but if you d-dial a nine at the end of the phone number, you can skip the recording."

##yumi surprised

voice "c-14ii-51.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait, seriously? {i}Nice!{/i}"

voice "c-14ii-52.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "B-b-but that's insider information! I'll get in a lot of trouble if people start using it!"

voice "c-14ii-53.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I mean, ideally, I'd like to forget about the hotline entirely, so I don't think there's much worry of me spreading it around."

"Sure enough, when I punch the modified number into my phone, I don't get a machine - just a normal ringing sound."

voice "c-14ii-54.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Sinful Stars hotline. How may I assist you?"

voice "c-14ii-55.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh - hey, Levi. It's Yumi again."

##Lucca happy ^_^

voice "c-14ii-56.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Levi!"

voice "c-14ii-57.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Lucca says hi."

voice "c-14ii-58.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Aww, hi."

voice "c-14ii-59.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "I, um, can't tell if this is a social call or an SOS. Did everything work out with Kamika?"

voice "c-14ii-60.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Er, that's the thing, actually. Could you convey to Satan that we're dealing with the situation on our own?"

voice "c-14ii-61.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Sure thing, I'd be happy to, but I haven't seen her around, so I can't say if she knows about it in the first place."

voice "c-14ii-62.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Probably just avoiding me because she knows I still demand an explanation for her leapfrogging my nun - "

voice "c-14ii-63.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Right, whatever. just tell her when you see her, okay?"

voice "c-14ii-64.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "*sigh* Mm-hmm. You got it."

voice "c-14ii-65.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Also, you might want to go check out what's going on in your dorm room."

voice "c-14ii-66.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What?"

voice "c-14ii-67.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Moe just went AFK in the middle of the damn raid, saying there's some commotion going on over there."

voice "c-14ii-68.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh, {i}shit{/i}!"

voice "c-14ii-69.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "Yeah, um, sorry to be the bearer of bad news."

voice "c-14ii-70.mp3" #Levi (???)
lev "...Kay bye."

#sfx phone hang up

"{i}Click.{/i}"

voice "c-14ii-71.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)

voice "c-14ii-72.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "...I-is it bad?"

voice "c-14ii-73.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Sounds bad."

voice "c-14ii-74.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "We should go?"

voice "c-14ii-75.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Probably."

#FLAG
voice "c-14ii-76.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Oh yeah, don't do the whole prism power thingy on my dorm room. I enjoy sleeping under a roof."

voice "c-14ii-77.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "I-I understand!"

"Getting our things together, we make our way towards my dorm room."
