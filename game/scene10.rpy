luc "Y-yikes... What a handful."

voice "c-10-2.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh yeah? Try living with her."

voice "c-10-3.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "Oof... I-I'm guessing you won't be h-heading back to the dorms yet?"

voice "c-10-4.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I've put up with her enough for the day. Think I'll stick around here a while. You?"

voice "c-10-5.mp3" #Lucca (Victoria Wong)
luc "N-no. I'm a little... a little tired after all that, so I'm gonna head back. B-bye..."

voice "c-10-6.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Later."

"She heads off, leaving me alone. But not for too long."

voice "c-10-7.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "'Sup."

voice "c-10-8.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh. hey, Stacey. Enjoy the show?"

voice "c-10-9.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Was okay. Seen better. Seen worse, too."

voice "c-10-10.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Huh. Doesn't seem like the others really thought that way."

voice "c-10-11.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "There's a poem about that. Two roads diverged in a wood. Took the road less traveled by, made all the difference, etcetera."

voice "c-10-12.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I think that just makes you a hipster."

voice "c-10-13.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "You wound me."

#Note that the above exchange is exactly the same whether or not the concert was actually good.

voice "c-10-14.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So is it me or were you chatting up the star of the show back there."

voice "c-10-15.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh god, don't even get me started on her."

voice "c-10-16.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Do it. I'll give you half a dollar."

voice "c-10-17.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You mean fifty cents right?"

voice "c-10-18.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "No."

voice "c-10-19.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Okay, there has to be a story there. Tell me that first."

voice "c-10-20.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh, the usual. I wanted the dollar, but so did someone else. So we did the tug of war thing and now I have this half-dollar I don't know what to do with."

voice "c-10-21.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It's kind of tragic, when you think about it. Two people after the same thing. Their greed destroys it, leaving only misery in their wake. Their bitter tears bring life to the barren earth so the cycle can continue anew."

voice "c-10-22.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Stacey, do you... do you want me to loan you a dollar?"

voice "c-10-23.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That'd be great. Or just, like, half a dollar? And some tape."

voice "c-10-24.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It'd have to be clear, though. Oh! Or green. I could make green work."

voice "c-10-25.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So that's the story of my life. Now I think you've got some venting to do."

voice "c-10-26.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Ugh. Okay, so her name is Kamika Malagic. She's my... new roommate."

voice "c-10-27.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Ohh, dollar story for a roommate story. Looks like I'm coming out on top on this one."

voice "c-10-28.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "So first time I meet her, she beat me to the room and stunk up the whole damn place."

voice "c-10-29.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Like, the bathroom? Or she was sweaty, I guess. If you aren't building up to the reveal that she has a pet skunk I'm gonna be disappointed."

voice "c-10-30.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "She called it her {i}pheromones.{/i}"

voice "c-10-31.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So sweat, then. Except she used the kinky word for it. So pretentious..."

voice "c-10-32.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Right?!{/i} I- Wait, no. That's not the problem here!"

voice "c-10-33.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh. Sorry. You were venting, so I was trying to be supportive."

voice "c-10-34.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I think I'm good without that."

voice "c-10-35.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Got it."

voice "c-10-36.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "So anyways, the {i}next{/i} thing-"

voice "c-10-37.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So I should probably say then that I don't actually think it's that pretentious. She was just making clever use of language to pretty up a bad situation. I've gotta respect that."

voice "c-10-38.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Stacey. You're not helping."

voice "c-10-39.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "You said not to. I'm sorta getting mixed signals here."

voice "c-10-40.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Just let me finish. {i}Then{/i} be supportive. Alright?"

voice "c-10-41.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yes, ma'am."

voice "c-10-42.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "So {i}anyways,{/i} she's insane! She has this ludicrous plan to seduce everyone in school, and then the entire rest of the world."

voice "c-10-43.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oof. World domination? She doesn't think that's a little tacky?"

voice "c-10-44.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Not at all! She even tried to make me her minion!"

voice "c-10-45.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Whoah. Wait wait wait. Is 'minion' her choice of words? Or yours."

voice "c-10-46.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Hers,{/i} obviously. What do I look like, some kind of loser?"

"She takes uncomfortably long to respond."

voice "c-10-47.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Okay. So she's definitely tacky, but at least she's owning it? Commitment's cool. I give iiiiit... a twelve?"

voice "c-10-48.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Stacey."

voice "c-10-49.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sorry."

voice "c-10-50.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "And then she had the gall to just sneak up on me in the middle of the night-"

voice "c-10-51.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh this cannot end well."

voice "c-10-52.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "-and started to cuddle me!"

voice "c-10-53.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I stand corrected."

voice "c-10-54.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "It's creepy! I am {i}not{/i} putting up with that kind of bullshit!"

voice "c-10-55.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Maybe she thought you were cold?"

voice "c-10-56.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "She could have used a blanket!"

voice "c-10-57.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah but that's way less kinky."

voice "c-10-58.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}That's the problem!{/i}"

voice "c-10-59.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh."

voice "c-10-60.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Okay, so lemme get this straight. You're saying you're frustrated because your roommate is smelly, doesn't accept responsibility, is a teensy bit evill, and doesn't respect your personal space."

voice "c-10-61.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yes! Exactly. Outside of the 'teensy' part."

voice "c-10-62.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Idunnooooooo, Yumi. Seems like you've got some bad yoga. You need to look within yourself, let your feng shui flow through you. Try some chakra, rearrange your vibes, that sorta thing."

voice "c-10-63.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "That is not what any of those words mean."

voice "c-10-64.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, I know. I was kidding. Got 'em."

voice "c-10-65.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But still. Maybe just chill? Sounds like a preeeetty typical roomie to me."

voice "c-10-66.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "She is {i}not{/i} a typical 'roomie'! She's just... a demon!"

voice "c-10-67.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oooooooooooooooooooooooooooohhhhhhh. Like Moe!"

voice "c-10-68.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I- That- I don't- What?"

voice "c-10-69.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "What kind of demon are we talking here? Like with the horns, hellfire, tail, musky scent that makes you moist?"

#I copypasted that but it's good

voice "c-10-70.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Although I guess if there was hellfire she'd set off the fire alarms. Although maybe hellfire doesn't make smoke?"

voice "c-10-71.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Otherwise hell would get really smokey. I'll have to ask."

voice "c-10-72.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You mean you actually believe me?"

voice "c-10-73.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Totes. And this kinda sounds like a problem, actually."

voice "c-10-74.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Like, a normal roomie trying to take over the world? Claaaaassic sitcom shit, nothin' to worry about. But a {i}demon.{/i} That's spicy."

voice "c-10-75.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh my god. Someone actually believes me! I... We might actually be able to do something about this!"

voice "c-10-76.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Thaaaaat's the spirit. We'll just talk this whole thing over with Moe, and he'll figure out what to do."

voice "c-10-77.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait a minute. You said Moe was a demon?"

voice "c-10-78.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. He's pretty great."

voice "c-10-79.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Why the {i}hell{/i} would we get another demon involved?"

voice "c-10-80.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Awwwwww, c'mon, he's not so bad."

voice "c-10-81.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "No! I am {i}not{/i} getting involved with more demons!"

voice "c-10-82.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Okay, okay. I know it {i}sounds{/i} bad."

voice "c-10-83.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Because it is!"

voice "c-10-84.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But think of it this way! If a lawyer is giving you problems, you get help from a lawyer, right?"

voice "c-10-85.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Right."

voice "c-10-86.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "And if a guy with a gun is giving you problems, you get help from another guy with a gun, riiiight?"

voice "c-10-87.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I mean... sort of?."

voice "c-10-88.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "And if a bear is giving you problems, you get help from another bear, {i}right?{/i}"

voice "c-10-89.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...No, Stacey. That is not what anyone does."

voice "c-10-90.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Two outta three. Which {i]means{/i} that this plan has a sixty-six point six six six and so on chance of working!"

voice "c-10-91.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "And since it's a plan about {i}demons,{/i} a repeating six is basically a hundred."

voice "c-10-92.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Okay, okay, you already had me at the lawyer. We have to get someone who knows the same rules so that we can play on an even field, right?"

voice "c-10-93.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, see? I knew you'd get it. You're pretty smart like that."

voice "c-10-94.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You're too kind."

voice "c-10-95.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Alriiiiight. He should be in the dorms right around now. C'mon."
