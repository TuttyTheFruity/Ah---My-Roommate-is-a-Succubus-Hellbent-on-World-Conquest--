"We make our way to the dorms. Stacey's walking pace is the agonizing middle ground where it's slow enough to be annoying, but fast enough that I can't justify calling her out on it."
"Slowly, it dawns on me that we're heading to the RA's room. Stacey knocks on the door."

voice "c-11-2.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Whoa. You don't know your own RA's name? Harsh."

voice "c-11-3.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Though I guess that's kinda Moe's style."

"..."

voice "c-11-4.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey, Moe! Couldja quit closing your porn and open the door already?"

"He opens the door and looks at me for a moment."

voice "c-11-5.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Oh. It's you."

voice "c-11-6.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Just... get inside where no one can hear you."

"He all but drags us in."

voice "c-11-7.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Okay, Moe. We've got some {i}serious{/i} shit to talk about."

voice "c-11-8.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "You say as you drag in the girl who was raving about a mysterious assailant with purple wings in her room."

voice "c-11-9.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh, so you talked about it already? Sweet."

voice "c-11-10.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "So anyways, does hellfire make smoke? I feel like since hell's underground there'd be no place for the smoke to go, so the whole place would just fill up."

voice "c-11-11.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "...Does she know?"

"He pointed at me."

voice "c-11-12.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yup."

voice "c-11-14.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey man, no fair. I asked you a question first."

voice "c-11-15.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "...Yes, Stacey. It makes smoke."

voice "c-11-16.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But how do they get rid of it."

voice "c-11-17.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Magic."

voice "c-11-18.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But that's too easy."

voice "c-11-19.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Fire that doesn't make smoke would be magic, too, Stacey."

voice "c-11-20.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Damn... Outwitted again."

voice "c-11-21.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Earth to Stacey! Bigger problems here!"

voice "c-11-22.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. But I figured that would take longer so I tried to get my thing out of the way first."

voice "c-11-23.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "So I take it there is a perfectly logical and not at all stupid reason for you to have told her?"

voice "c-11-24.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Tooootally, man. Whole thing's legit. See, her roommate's a {i}demon{/i}."

voice "c-11-25.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Oh my god, you actually believed her."

voice "c-11-26.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Stacey there is not a college student alive who has not called their roommate a demon at least once."

voice "c-11-27.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Naaaaaaah, Yumi's chill. She'd never say that unless she really meant it."

voice "c-11-28.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "She's right. About the meaning it part, I mean. There's nothing 'chill' about this."

voice "c-11-29.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Well. I guess there's no helping it."

moe "'The Debonaire Demon of Desire', 'The Spanish Stallion', 'The Hunk of Hearts'..."

voice "c-11-34.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Though I am best represented by my chiseled image and striking features, such names follow me wherever I go."

voice "c-11-35.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "But one name stands above them all- My true name, which I only share with friends, family... and {i}lovers.{/i}"

voice "c-11-36.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "I am Asmodeus... the Demon of Lust!"

voice "c-11-37.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Swoon."

voice "c-11-38.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I- What... That's not right! That's not right at all!"

voice "c-11-39.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yumi, c'mon. You're supposed to say 'but you're not even Spanish'. And then Moe can say 'It is not the truth that matters, but the fantasy through which we view it...'"

voice "c-11-40.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "I don't talk like that."

voice "c-11-41.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "And for the record, you don't count under 'friends, family, and lovers'. I also share the name with business associates."

voice "c-11-42.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I made him take that out of the speech when we were workshopping it. Just doesn't flow right, you know?"

voice "c-11-43.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I don't care about that! {i}Kamika{/i} is the Demon of Lust. So who the hell are you?"

voice "c-11-44.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Oh, god. {i}That's{/i} your demon?"

voice "c-11-45.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Okay, first off, Kamika's not the Demon of Lust. Not even close. 'Envy' is a little more like it."

voice "c-11-46.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What? Why would she even lie about that?"

voice "c-11-47.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Oh, Idunno, maybe because she's the Demon of Envy and being a lying self-centered bitch is literally what she does for a living?"

voice "c-11-48.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Okay, I get your point."

voice "c-11-49.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "If she's your roommate demon, that might be a problem."

voice "c-11-50.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "You might have heard from hear about Satan's efforts to make a pop idol group. The 'Sinful Stars'."

voice "c-11-51.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Not from her, but I've heard. Unfortunately."

voice "c-11-52.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Kamika was cast as the Demon of Envy, but I guess that just wasn't good enough for Little Ms. Has-to-Have-Everything."

voice "c-11-53.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "She threw a tantrum that she couldn't be the Demon of Lust, then went rogue."

voice "c-11-54.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "It was really shocking. A whole zero people were surprised."

voice "c-11-55.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I've heard of you guys from... another incident, but nobody ever talked about Kamika."

voice "c-11-56.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Can you blame them?"

voice "c-11-57.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Not... really."

voice "c-11-58.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You're not going to ask about me meeting Satan before?"

voice "c-11-59.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Nope. Don't really care. If I heard stories about every time Satan got into trouble, I wouldn't have time for anything else."

voice "c-11-60.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Not even porn?"

voice "c-11-61.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Stacey, would you quit it with the porn talk?"

voice "c-11-62.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But I thought this was a safe space for conversation."

voice "c-11-63.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "We have a guest!"

voice "c-11-64.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh, yeah. Sorry."

"I ignored that."

voice "c-11-65.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Are you allowed to just... go rogue in hell?"

voice "c-11-66.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Sort of. Satan doesn't do much about it as long as it's all still fun and games to her. All she's done is send a fruit basket."

voice "c-11-67.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, what can {i}you{/i} do about it?"

voice "c-11-68.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Depends. Has she actually done anything?"

voice "c-11-69.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "She made my room smell with pheromones!"

voice "c-11-70.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Everyone knows that's just a kinky word for sweat. Typical roommate problem. Take that up with her, not me."

voice "c-11-71.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "And she's plotting world domination!"

voice "c-11-72.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Yes, but she's an {i}idiot{/i}. She'll do a perfectly fine job of sabotaging that herself."

voice "c-11-73.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Fine. But she also snuck up and cuddled me in the middle of the night!"

voice "c-11-74.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Oh. Yeah, demons just sort of do that sometimes."

voice "c-11-75.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It's pretty great."

voice "c-11-76.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "If you want, I can write her up for sexual harassment. You know, with my RA powers. The demon ones can stay home."

voice "c-11-77.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Ugh. I can just deal with that myself. But aren't you worried that she'll do something worse?"

voice "c-11-78.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Kamika has been in a constant state of {i}attempting{/i} unbelievably stupid shit for as long as I've known her..."

voice "c-11-79.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "...But she's never actually succeeded at anything other than making herself look like a child. I think we're fine."

voice "c-11-80.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "If she does something {i}actually{/i} evil, come get me."

voice "c-11-81.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Fine."

voice "c-11-82.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Are we done here?"

voice "c-11-83.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Actually, there's one more thing."

"I point at Stacey."

voice "c-11-84.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Just how do you two know each other, exactly?"

voice "c-11-85.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Oh, that's an easy one. I summoned him."

voice "c-11-86.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Why?{/i}"

voice "c-11-87.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Was bored, I guess."

voice "c-11-88.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "And you two just stick around each other?"

voice "c-11-89.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Why not? I know Moe seems a little prickly and like he spends all his time on porn, but he's pretty cool when you get to know him."

voice "c-11-90.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Stacey, what did I say?"

voice "c-11-91.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "C'mooon, man. You've got three monitors. You're not fooling anybody."

voice "c-11-92.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "That... {i}is{/i} a lot of monitors."

voice "c-11-93.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "I'm a computer science student! I need them to work!"

voice "c-11-94.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That's what they all saaaaaay."

voice "c-11-95.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Fine. I program on one monitor while the other two have content that's... less educational."

voice "c-11-96.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait. {i}Two{/i} extra monitors? But that... why?"

voice "c-11-97.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey. Not likin' your tone, there, Yumi."

voice "c-11-98.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sure, I give Moe shit, but I know what buttons to push without bothering him, and I don't really judge."

voice "c-11-99.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I mean, if the programming gets done, where's the harm?"

voice "c-11-100.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "And the programming {i}does{/i} get done. For the record."

voice "c-11-101.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Plus, I actually think it's really cool of him. Like, you know how people like to pirate this stuff?"

voice "c-11-102.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Because porn is all taboo and not important so we shouldn't have to pay for it or something?"

voice "c-11-103.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "But Moe always makes sure to get things legally if he can. Total respect."

voice "c-11-104.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I... guess I never really looked at it that way?"

voice "c-11-105.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Honest work should receive honest compensation and that's all I'll say."

voice "c-11-106.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "See? Wicked cool."

voice "c-11-107.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "And it's kind of a two way street. Like, most people think I'm weird because I like the occult, and I've never found anyone as open minded about it as Moe."

voice "c-11-108.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I think there's a reason for that."

voice "c-11-109.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Doesn't really matter if there's a reason or not. Point is we both know we're weird, so we can be honest with each other. So we keep each other around."

voice "c-11-110.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That answer your question?"

voice "c-11-111.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Did I ask?"

voice "c-11-112.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, a little while ago. Sorry if I blabbed your ear off. I get a little defensive about it."

voice "c-11-113.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "No, it's fine! Sorry if I sounded critical."

voice "c-11-114.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Now, if you're done violating my privacy, can you get going? I'm busy."

"Stacey opens her mouth."

voice "c-11-115.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Stacy, if you're about to make the joke I think you're going to make, I swear."

"Stacey closes her mouth."

voice "c-11-116.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Aaalright. Don't enjoy yourself too much while we're gone, big guy."

voice "c-11-117.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "{i}Dammit,{/i} you too?"

"Stacey and I snicker as we start to head out."

voice "c-11-118.mp3" #Moe (CJ Heineman)
moe "Keep me posted on Kamika, alright? She's too stupid to be dangerous, but we may as well play it safe."

voice "c-11-119.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You got it, Moe."
