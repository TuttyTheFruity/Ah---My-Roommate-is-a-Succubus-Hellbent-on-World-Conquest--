"After some deliberation, I finally decide that Kamika can't do too much harm in a single day. If she really has that much trouble seducing me, then she's fighting an uphill battle with the rest of the student body."

"Don't get me wrong - I'm not easy, and the student body here isn't exactly playing hard to get."

"It's more to say that she's just {i}that bad{/i}."

"Not that I have any real faith in my peers..."

"Jesus Christ, I'm starting to think like my brother, aren't I?"

"Whatever. I'm making plans with Stacey. I need to go out somewhere that won't remind me of that god awful stench back at my dormroom."

voice "c-7ii-2.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)

voice "c-7ii-3.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Your creative juices?"

voice "c-7ii-4.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sureee."

voice "c-7ii-5.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "R-right..."

"I gather my stuff, art materials and all, and we head out. It's only a short walk to the campus cafe, and from what I've heard, the coffee here is at least half decent."

"We fill some small mugs with drip coffee, and retrieve some cream and sugar."

"I put a good spoonful of sugar in, while Stacey puts in a few heaping spoonfuls."

voice "c-7ii-6.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Is that enough??"

voice "c-7ii-7.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Nah, you're right. I need some more."

voice "c-7ii-8.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Ha ha, you snarky little - oh jeez, you weren't joking."

voice "c-7ii-9.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "What, you were? Is your coffee black? That shit's gross, man."

voice "c-7ii-10.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "No, my coffee is normal. I want some coffee with my coffee, thank you very much."

voice "c-7ii-11.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I need some sugar to keep me awake."

voice "c-7ii-12.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Isn't that what the caffeine's for?"

voice "c-7ii-13.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Caffeine? Since when?"

voice "c-7ii-14.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "It's CAFFEINE, Stacey - you know what? Nevermind."

"Ignoring her, we sit down at a nearby table, and I immediately pull out my art supplies, getting to work on some school assignments."

voice "c-7ii-15.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Working already? Shit man, you don't need to try so hard."

voice "c-7ii-16.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Don't I? It's Uni. Weren't you the one that said coffee gets your juices flowing?"

voice "c-7ii-17.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "That doesn't mean I want to {i}actually{/i} work. It's just Uni. You don't need to go so ham, fam."

voice "c-7ii-18.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You're not worried about your work?"

voice "c-7ii-19.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Nah, it's good."

voice "c-7ii-20.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What do you even do here? Like, I know you're a student here, but..."

voice "c-7ii-21.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "No shit."

voice "c-7ii-22.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I know right, could have fooled me."

voice "c-7ii-24.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I'm a dramatic writer."

voice "c-7ii-25.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Dramatic?"

voice "c-7ii-26.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "You know, screenplays and shit. I have a project for it, like you and your art."

voice "c-7ii-27.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Ah. Then by all means, get working."

voice "c-7ii-28.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I didn't sign up for this to be a study date."

voice "c-7ii-29.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What else would we do?"

voice "c-7ii-30.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I dunno."

"In an effort to avoid awkward silence, I push right on through."

voice "c-7ii-31.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, tell me about this project that you should be working on."

"Stacey drags out a roughshod notebook, doodles littering the cover, obviously well used."

"She flips through a few pages, finding her spot amidst her barely legible handwriting."

voice "c-7ii-32.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "What about it?"

voice "c-7ii-33.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, what is it? What's it about?"

voice "c-7ii-34.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I guess you could say it's a screenplay about a dark prince who summons a demon from the depths of hell to do his bidding."

"That's a little on the nose, isn't it?"

voice "c-7ii-35.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Why a dark prince, and why demons? Seems a little specific."

voice "c-7ii-36.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Lots of people like occult stories. You act like you've never summoned a demon before."

"Why am I a magnet for occult fetishists."

voice "c-7ii-37.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well yes, of course I have. Since that's such a normal thing to do."

voice "c-7ii-38.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Cool."

"And she accepts it, just like that."

voice "c-7ii-39.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}No{/i}, Stacey, no I haven't."

voice "c-7ii-40.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Damn. And to think I thought you were one of the cool ones."

voice "c-7ii-41.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You thought I was cool?"

voice "c-7ii-42.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Nah, you're right, what was I thinking?"

voice "c-7ii-43.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What, the demon part or the cool part?"

voice "c-7ii-44.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah."

voice "c-7ii-45.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Hey!"

voice "c-7ii-46.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I'm thinking of killing a few people, too."

voice "c-7ii-47.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "What?"

voice "c-7ii-48.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, it's pretty dope to kill people, don't you think?"

voice "c-7ii-49.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "How about no?"

voice "c-7ii-50.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "C'mon, you've never had the urge to murder someone?"

voice "c-7ii-51.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Never seriously??"

voice "c-7ii-52.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. Especially when the character's a reader favorite."

voice "c-7ii-53.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Wait."

voice "c-7ii-54.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah. Actually, if you want to help, we could do a reading of the first part of the script right now."

"...Eh. Why not. Might be fun."
"Hell, maybe it's a love story. Those are cute."
"...Oh who am I kidding..."

voice "c-7ii-55.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Alright, sure."

"Stacey unceremoniously rips out some pages of her notebook, and hands them to me."

"Wow. I can't read any of this."

voice "c-7ii-56.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "I can wait."

voice "c-7ii-57.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You'll have to, because I can't understand any of this."

voice "c-7ii-58.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Here."

"Stacey pulls her chair around next to me, and looks over the sheet with me."

voice "c-7ii-59.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Oh."

"She flips the page right side up, and points to the right lines."

voice "c-7ii-60.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "The ones you'd wanna read are highlighted in red."

voice "c-7ii-61.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Yeah, this is less a screenplay and more a mosaic."

voice "c-7ii-62.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It'll look better when I print it off. Just my personal notes."

voice "c-7ii-63.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Whatever works for you."

voice "c-7ii-64.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah."

"I squint my eyes, finally making some sense of the first few lines."

voice "c-7ii-65.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Oh, my dear prince, I have failed you! How can I ever make this up to you?{/i}"

"This is ridiculous."

voice "c-7ii-66.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Am I even worthy of your love and devotion?{/i}"

voice "c-7ii-67.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "{i}You are not worthy, weakling. You have failed me yet again.{/i}"

voice "c-7ii-68.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "{i}Oh please, master, grant me mercy! I won't fail you again!{/i}"

voice "c-7ii-69.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "{i}Yes, young one. You won't.{/i}"

"Wait."

voice "c-7ii-70.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...You killed my character. Why'd we run the one part of the script where {i}the character I play{/i} dies?? "

voice "c-7ii-71.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "It fits you, doesn't it? We can go through a different part of the script if you want."

voice "c-7ii-72.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Will I live this time?"

voice "c-7ii-73.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "..."

voice "c-7ii-74.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "No."

voice "c-7ii-75.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You masochist."

voice "c-7ii-76.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey, don't blame me. It's the main character's fault. {i}He's{/i} the masochist."

voice "c-7ii-77.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Is this story really all about some dude killing off his subordinates? What's the point to it all?"

voice "c-7ii-78.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "To him, yes. What the story is {i}really{/i} about is his power fantasy, his own delusion of grandeur. In reality, he's nothing - just some normal kid."

voice "c-7ii-79.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "He's lost in his own head. He never actually summons demons in the first place."

voice "c-7ii-80.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "O-oh. That's actually kind of sad."

voice "c-7ii-81.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "The story caters to a specific audience and forces them to reevaluate themselves."

voice "c-7ii-82.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "That's deep. To be honest, I didn't expect that from you. Not that I expected you to be a shitty writer, but when you mentioned being into occult stuff... I'm jaded from past experiences."

voice "c-7ii-83.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Well, whoever you're thinking of, they're probably the target audience."

voice "c-7ii-84.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "You're definitely not wrong about that."

voice "c-7ii-85.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Also, if I'm ever in the need of money, there's a huge fetish market out there for occult shit."

voice "c-7ii-86.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "...Why did I ever believe in you."

voice "c-7ii-87.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Hey, a writer's gotta do what a writer's gotta do. You'd know, you're an artist."

voice "c-7ii-88.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "I'm not planning on selling out."

voice "c-7ii-89.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Yeah, keep telling yourself that."

"Rolling my eyes, I hand her back her script."

voice "c-7ii-90.mp3" #Yumi (Kathy Pfautsch)
yum "Well, when you're at the interesting bits of the story, let me know! Sounds like a screenplay I might enjoy."

voice "c-7ii-91.mp3" #Stacey (Ashe Thurman)
sta "Sure."

"After some chiding by me, Stacey pulls her chair back to her original position and gets to work on her own stuff."

"I look at my own project, and sigh. I've got a long ways to go."
